      <h1>Vishwas BE IT</h1>
      <p>
        I made this website, just so that i can have a backup of all the
        materials, notes of mine and share easily. Hence this website has all
        the documents related to my BE-IT journey like Books, Notes,
        Assignments, Test Papers, Other Materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is just for sharing purpose, Not to make a inappropriate use of it,
        hence it is just for the help of the students
